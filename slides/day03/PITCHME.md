### Work Time

Make notes as you work:
* A list of games that interest you
* Ideas for finding out who built the game
* Names as you find them
* Other leads and clues

Note:

Goal is to find interesting and useful ideas about how games are created. Especially about how designers come up with ideas and turn them into games. You're not done till the period is over.
