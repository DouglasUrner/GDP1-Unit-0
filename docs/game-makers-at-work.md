Creating a game - or any interactive experience - requires a diverse array of talents: designers, artists, programmers, animators, writers, the list goes on and on. On some game projects there are huge teams with each member filling a specific role, on others the team is tiny and people are valued for their breadth of experience and ability to shift gears.

One of the best ways to build your stock of ideas for developing games is to explore the creative process of other developers. So, we're going to try to find articles or interviews with game developers whose work you admire.

Who are the people (*not* the company or studio) who developed one of your favorite games? See if you can track down the designer(s) and programmer(s) that worked on a game that you enjoy. Then write up a paragraph or two which:

1. Briefly describes the game **and** lists the designer and programming teams – the names of the actual people who did the work. On a big project, list either the team leads or the developers who have an online presence focused on the game development process.

2. Then, search for articles, interviews, or other places where they describe their process. Add links to those materials to your document.

**Submit a PDF of your document.**
