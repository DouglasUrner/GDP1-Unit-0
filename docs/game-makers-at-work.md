Creating a game - or any interactive experience - requires a diverse array of talents: designers, artists, programmers, animators, writers, the list goes on and on. On some game projects there are huge teams with each member filling a specific role, on others the team is tiny and people are valued for their breadth of experience and ability to shift gears.

Who worked to create one of your favorite games? See if you can track down the designer(s) and programmer(s) that worked on a game that you enjoy. Write up a paragraph or two that briefly describes the game and lists the designer and programming teams. Check out the "online presence" of the developers – websites, blogs, articles and videos, etc. – and link to them.
