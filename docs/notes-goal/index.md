Decide on a goal that will help to make your developer's journal a better tool for you as you work on your games. Aim for a goal which is:

* **S**pecific: clearly and simply state what you are going to do.
* **M**easursurable: describe how you will know if you are on track to meet your goal and if you have met it.
* **A**cheivable: make it realistic for **you** in the time you have available.
* **R**esult-focused: state what will be acheived - not just what you will do.
* **T**ime-bounded: give yourself a deadline.

After you formulate your goal, write it on the first page of your notebook so that you can easily find it.

### Examples

I will develop the habit of note taking by starting my notes at the begining of class every day. By the end of the semester I want to initiate taking notes on my own.

During group work I will take notes during discussions. By the end of the quarter, my notes will usually include something about each person's ideas.
